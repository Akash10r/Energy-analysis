Task1 : Make a clustering analysis of various variables. Provide with insightful results with visualizations. 
Task2 : Also use multiple linear regression to provide a regression line between (AC temp, Room temp , Time) and Current. 
Task3 : Make meaningful heatmaps (E.g Power usage for a day)
Task4 : Given the current time, room temperature and ac temperature, Predict the current drawn.
